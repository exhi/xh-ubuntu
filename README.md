# Hoist Dockerfile: xh-ubuntu

[Hoist React](https://github.com/exhi/hoist-react/) apps can be deployed via Docker containers running Tomcat (for Hoist's Grails based back-end) and nginx (to serve compiled client JS/CSS and other assets).

This repo contains a minimal utility image for use where we want to start a container and jump into a shell with fancy things like a text editor available for immedaite use.

This image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xhio/xh-ubuntu/).
